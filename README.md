App Evaluation
Mobile: this application would be developed for mobile, web but could be just as viable on a computer. The feature would not be limited to mobile devices, but the mobile version could potentially have more features
Market: Anyone could choose this app, and keep it safe, people would be organized into age groups.
Habit: This app can be used during election times.
